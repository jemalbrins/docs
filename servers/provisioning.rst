Provisioning
============

New servers can be provisioned with the `server builder <https://github.com/newsapps/servers>`_ scripts.  See `this ticket <https://tribune.unfuddle.com/a#/projects/30/tickets/by_number/1352%5Bcomment_5641%5D>`_ for information about how the scripts were used to provision admin servers for election site data loading and static site backing.
