Editing these documents
-----------------------

These documents are written in a markup language called `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (rst) and build with a documentation generator called `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.  reStructuredText is a bit more complicated to use than Markdown, but is better suited for documentation because it has conventions for linking between documentation sections.  Check out the "User Documentation" section at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for help.  In most cases, you should be able to pick up the syntax from the existing files.
