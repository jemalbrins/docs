Command line/Tarbell/P2P cheat sheet
============
*UPDATED: February 2016*

This guide is intended to help those who need a quick mental refresher when launching new projects and otherwise adapting old workflows (read: manually coding lots of things) into the tarbell-based workflow. There will be plenty of exceptions to the rules of thumb layed out below, but they are good starting points until you develop a deeper understanding of the tools you are using.

```make html```
```cd _build/html; python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9123```

Starting new project (with P2P template)
----------------------
   1. ``tarbell newproject <projectname>`` will start a new project and begin the process of configuring it.
   #. Choose the **Tribune template (p2p).**
   #. Tarbell will ask about installing **requirements**. Unless you're told otherwise by a project collaborator, you don't need to install requirements when asked. 
   #. Tarbell will ask about **Sass**. You should almost always generate styles using Sass. It's better.
   #. Tarbell will ask about **Browserify**. Fewer projects will require bundled Javascript requiring Browserify.
   #. Tarbell will ask about using **Unfuddle**. You should. The default project of **60** is the graphics projects and should be used in nearly all cases.
   #. Yes, create a **repo.**
   #. You don't need to create tickets. You should already have created one before starting this process. In fact, the repo address from the previous step should be added to your ticket. Get the address `here <https://tribune.unfuddle.com/a#/repositories>`_.
   #. ``npm install:`` Should be done right away after staring a new project. This let's you use grunt/gulp

Node/NPM
----------------------
   - ``grunt`` (or ``gulp``): Makes sass into css. It also does lots of other things.
   - ``grunt watch`` (or ``gulp watch``): Run this in it's own tab and it will automatically run grunt (or gulp) when it detects changes to a file. 

Git 
----------------------
`Git documentation <https://git-scm.com/doc>`_

   - ``git status:`` See what uncommitted changes exist in a directory
   - ``git add:`` Tell git to watch a file or files for changes
   - ``git commit:`` Tell git that the changes you made should be kept.
   - ``git pull`` Brings changes from elsewhere onto your machine. **Never push before you pull.**
   - ``git push`` Overwrites content elsewhere with your changes. **Never push before you pull.**

Tarbell
----------------------
`Tarbell documentation <https://tarbell.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
   
   - Starting a new project:
      1. ``tarbell newproject <projectname>``
      #. ``cd /path/to/<projectname>``
      #. ``npm install``

   - Where does the content go? In the **_content.html** it goes between the content tags::
      
      {% block content %}
      {% endblock content %}

   - Where do your scripts go? Links to scripts go in the **library_scripts** block::

      {% block library_scripts %}
         <script></script>
      {% endblock %}

   - Link to stylesheets, including the one you're making, get added to the scripts array::

      {% block scripts %}
         <script>
         (function(document) {
           // Note the quote marks surrounding each link 
           // and the commas seperating them.
           var CSS = [
             "//{{ ROOT_URL }}/css/styles.css",
             "//{{ ROOT_URL }}/css/another_styles.css",
             "//{{ ROOT_URL }}/css/yet_another_styles.css"
           ];    
           CSS.forEach(function(url) {
             var link = document.createElement('link');
             link.setAttribute('rel', 'stylesheet');
             link.setAttribute('href', url);
             document.head.appendChild(link);
           });
         })(document);    
         </script>
      {% endblock scripts %}

   - Where do your hand-written scripts go? Litte scripts, such as a dataTables or clicker initilization can go in the **scripts** block::

      {% block scripts %}
         <script>
            // Code here
         </script>
      {% endblock %}
   - **Reminder:** When linking to things like images and stylesheets, your url should look like this: ``http://{{ ROOT_URL/path/to/image/or/other/asset }}``. The ``ROOT_URL`` variable makes sure that your page can reference the assets regardless of whether you are running it locally or on P2P.
   - Helpful commands for the command line
      - ``tarbell`` On it's own, this command brings up a more detailed list of possible commands
      - ``tarbell install <git@repo_url>`` Downloads and installs tarbell projects locally
      - ``tarbell spreadsheet`` Automatically opens an associated spreadsheet in a new browser tab.
      - ``tarbell publish`` or ``tarbell publish staging`` Whether publishing to P2P or off platform, this makes your project viewable in the tower at `apps.beta.tribapps.com <https://apps.beta.tribapps.com>`_
      - ``tarbell publish production`` If publishing to P2P, this uploads your site into the designated P2P slug. Otherwise, if ppublishing off platform, this makes your project viewable to the whole world (and Google) at your production URL, probably `graphics.chicagotribune.com <http://graphics.chicagotribune.com >`_

Jinja
---
Jinja is the templating language you will use in Tarbell projects. It's very handy. The `Jinja documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_ is very straightforward and accessible. You'll almost certainly need a `for loop <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#list-of-control-structures>`_ and maybe a couple `if statements <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#if>`_ 
Also, remember what this syntax means:
   - To ouput the value of a variable, use double curly braces::
      
      {{ This is the value of a variable }}

   - To have Jinja *do something*, use a percent sign::

      {% This is a command %}

   - Jinja comments will not show up in your rendered pages. They are a good place to stash notes instead of HTML comments (``<!-- -->``). The readers don't need to see that. Comments are wrapped with a hashtag::

      {# This is a comment #}


Sass
----------------------
Sass is an expansion/improvement on old-school styles `Sass documentation <http://sass-lang.com/>`_ Among it's useful features:

   - ``$variables`` Must begin with a **$.**
   - ``@import`` Is how you combine sass files into a single document.
   - ``@include`` Is how you use a mixin.

Bash/Command line hints
-----------------------
Here is a good tutorial on command line stuff. Some basics you'll probably want:
   - ``ls <path/to/directory>`` Lists all the files in a given directory
   - ``pwd`` Outputs your **p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory
   - ``cd <path/to/target/directory>`` **c**hanges **d**irectory to the given path 
   - ``subl <path/to/target/directory>`` If configured properly, will open the contents of the given file/directory in sublime
   - ``~`` is the shorthand version of the logged-in user's root directory.


JS/CSS tools
-----------------------
*Many of these will be temporary as we flesh out our tarbell blueprint and related tools. In the near future, you will download some of these components using node/npm and include them in you project as needed.*

- base css (can be accessed via sass)
   https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.apps.chicagotribune.com/graphics-toolbox/tribuneBase/tribune-graphics-base-1.3.css

- skeleton (can also be used via sass)
      https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.apps.chicagotribune.com/graphics-toolbox/skeleton.css 

- makePanels
   - https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.apps.chicagotribune.com/graphics-toolbox/makePanels/1.4/jquery.makePanels.1.4.css

   - <script type='text/javascript' src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.apps.chicagotribune.com/graphics-toolbox/makePanels/1.4/jquery.makePanels.1.4.min.js"></script>
   
   - Initialize makePanels.js::

      $('#target').makePanels({
         type:"buttons",    /* Options are "none", "buttons" or "dropdown" */
         transitionSpeed: 0, /* 0=instant, 1000 = 1 second */
         showForwardBackButtons:false, /* duh! */
         alignNav:"left" /* Also can be "left" */
         matchPanelHeightsToggle:false, /* This will make all panels the same height */
         showFirst:"" // The ID of the panel which should be visible on init
      });

- dataTables
   - <script type='text/javascript' src="https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.10/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js"></script>
   - <script type='text/javascript' src="http://cdn.datatables.net/responsive/1.0.1/js/dataTables.responsive.js"></script>  
   - https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.apps.chicagotribune.com/graphics-toolbox/dataTables/tribune-datatables.min.css
   - Initialize dataTabels.js (This can easily become very complicated, but this is a very basic use)::

      var table = $('#targetTable').DataTable({
         "paging": false, /* If true, the table will only show a small number of rows at a time */
         "lengthMenu": [[50,100,500,-1], [50, 100,500,"All"]], /* if paging=true, then this controls the options for how many to show on a single page ... [ options ][ menu labels ]*/
         "searching": true, /* should the user be allowed to filter the table? */
         "ordering": true, /* Should user be allowed to reorder? */
         "order": [[ 4, "desc" ]], /* By which column should the table be ordered at first */
         "responsive": true /* Should the table hide columns in the child row? */
      });  
- jQuery
   <script type='text/javascript' src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
