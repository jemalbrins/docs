Are you just getting started? Go to the tarbell section :ref:`_blurb-tarbell`

Check that your blurb blurbs in p2p
-----------------------------------

Remember that p2p_slug you gave your blurb when you set it up in tarbell? We'll use that to locate it in p2p (click the search icon and navigate the not-at-all-confusing search). Scroll down to the "HTML" section and inspect the html. If your blurb talks to css or js files, make sure they are in their ``<link>`` and ``<script>`` tags with the right path (usually, this means you added {{ROOT_URL}} when including the files in the blurb).

If that looks okay, click "Preview" and realize that (most likely) it was not okay. Start debugging and/or asking favors. If it looks good, go tell everyone: first try!

Adding your blurb to a story
----------------------------

Your blurb, by blurbs' nature, as is known by all blurb masters, probably goes inside a story. Find what that story's slug is and find it in p2p, too. Alternatively, if you're just testing your blurb blurbs (as you should), find your tester story of choice. A handy one is
	``chi-test-test-test-20150423``

At the top of your blurb's page, click on "Relationships" and then add your blurb to the story you chose. Before you leave your blurb's page, set its state to "Live." We live dangerously.

Now go to the story, using the slug you found, scroll to the "Body" section, and look for an icon that looks like two squares about to fist-bump, separated by dashed lines. Wonder why this is the icon you want. It is the "Add Embedded Item," which should then go into the story.

What are all these attributes in p2p?
------------------------------------

I don't know! How about you find out and tell us? Here's what we know now:

Preview your blurb
------------------
In the p2p page where the story with the blurbs, look for a preview button at the top of the window. Click that. Preview. Cry and/or profit, you just monetized some premium and verified content!
