How Tribune commenting works
----------------------------

The Chicago Tribune primarily uses Facebook commenting, which means that all you need to do to
include comments on your project is add a bit of code to any page that should have comments. 
Comments can also be moderated by an administrator of the Facebook app you choose - by default, 
Tarbell uses its own Facebook app for commenting, but you can use a new app instead if you prefer.

Example using Tarbell
---------------------

If you're using the `Tribune Tarbell template <tarbell.html#templates>`_, all you need to do is
ensure that there's an element (preferably a ``<div>``) on the page with the id
``"fb-comments"``: ::

    <div id="fb-comments"></div>

Tarbell will take care of the rest, assuming you're still using the base template. If you've made
changes to the base template, you'll need to preserve the ``{% block comments %}`` and 
``{% block comments_js %}`` sections and the ``fb:app_id`` meta tag in the
``{% block comments_app_id %}`` section.

If you'd like to change the disclaimer text, copy ``_base/_comments.html`` to your root directory,
and update it as described in the next section.

Changing disclaimer text
------------------------

The disclaimer text is what appears above the Facebook comments box, briefly explaining what it is
and what our policies are. In order to customize it, you need to find a block of code like the 
following: ::

    window.add_facebook_comments = function() {
        var disclaimer = '<div class="fb-comment-disclaimer">The Tribune is using Facebook comments 
            on stories. To post a comment, log into Facebook and then add your comment. To report 
            spam or abuse, click the "X" in the upper right corner of the comment box. In certain 
            circumstances, we will take down entire comment boards. Our commenting guidelines can 
            be found
            <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/about/chi-discussions-faq,0,980840;htmlstory">
            here »</a>.</div>';

        var fbml = disclaimer + '<fb:comments href="'
            + window.location.protocol
            + '//'
            + window.location.host
            + window.location.pathname
            + '" num_posts="10" width="620"></fb:comments>';

        $("#fb-comments").append(fbml);
    }

All you need to change is the text on the line beginning ``var disclaimer``. Replace everything
between ``<div class="fb-comment-disclaimer">`` and ``</div>`` with whatever new disclaimer you
like.

Moderating comments
-------------------

Comment moderation using this system is handled entirely through Facebook, in particular their
`Comment Moderation Tool <https://developers.facebook.com/tools/comments>`_. If you've already been 
added as a moderator for the app you're using to set up these comments, then visiting that page
will show you all recent comments and allow you to take action. Visiting the page containing the 
comment box will also allow you to moderate them, once you've logged into Facebook.

In order to add yourself as a moderator, you or an administrator of the app you're using should
visit the `Comment Moderation Tool <https://developers.facebook.com/tools/comments>`_, select the
app you're using and click on Settings. You'll need to have a Facebook account in order to become
an administrator or moderator.

Where to go for Facebook questions
----------------------------------

Since Facebook is the developer and maintainer of the commenting code, they're the best place to 
look for any questions you have about creating and administering apps. `Facebook's App Dashboard 
<https://developers.facebook.com/apps>`_ is the clearinghouse for everything app-related, and `their
commenting documentation is here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments>`_.

Full example for non-Tarbell sites
----------------------------------

If you'd like to include Facebook Comments on a non-Tarbell site, you'll need to include a bit
more boilerplate code. Here's everything you'll need to include on any page that contains a
comments box.

In your page's ``<head>``, you need to add a meta tag that tells Facebook what app to use for your
comments: ::

    <meta property="fb:app_id" content="INSERT_APP_ID_HERE">

Tarbell projects use the app id ``306836229411287`` but you're free to set up and use a different
one.

Create a ``<div>`` element somewhere on the page that you'd like the comments box to appear, and
give it the id ``fb-comments``: ::
    
    <div id="fb-comments"></div>

Finally, at the bottom of your page code, add the following: ::

    <div id="fb-root"></div>    

    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function(d, s, id) {
            var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
            if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
            js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
            js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=APP_ID_GOES_HERE";
            fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
        }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
    </script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
       window.add_facebook_comments = function() {
         var disclaimer = '<div class="fb-comment-disclaimer">The Tribune is using Facebook 
            comments on stories. To post a comment, log into Facebook and then add your comment. To 
            report spam or abuse, click the "X" in the upper right corner of the comment box. In 
            certain circumstances, we will take down entire comment boards. Our commenting 
            guidelines can be found
            <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/about/chi-discussions-faq,0,980840.htmlstory">
            here »</a>.</div>';

         var fbml = disclaimer + '<fb:comments href="'
             + window.location.protocol
             + '//'
             + window.location.host
             + window.location.pathname
             + '" num_posts="10" width="620"></fb:comments>';

          $("#fb-comments").append(fbml);
       }

       if ( $('meta[property="fb:app_id"]').length > 0 ) {
          window.add_facebook_comments();
       }
    </script>

In the line that begins ``js.src = "//connect.facebook.net...``, replace ``APP_ID_GOES_HERE`` with
the app id you're using for these comments.

You can change the disclaimer text by updating the line that begins ``var disclaimer = '<div...``
(see `the above section <#changing-disclaimer-text>`_ for more details).

Note that you can attach the comments to a differently-named element on the page by changing the
line that contains ``$("#fb-comments").append(fbml);``, but you shouldn't need to in most cases.
