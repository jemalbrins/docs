Web Applications
================

This is a place to document "web applications."  I'm not sure of a great definition for these, but I'll define them as "things we've built that run on a server and return different information based on different user requests."  This is different than many of the static sites that we build where users either see the same HTML, or where dynamic interactions happen on the client side with `JavaScript`.

The goal of this documentation is to give some background if you encounter a dependency on one of these applications in the code of another project.  It's also a good way to keep track of our potential technical debt. These applications tend to be somewhat complicated and need to run on servers which cost money and need periodic maintenance.

Services
--------

A service is different than a site because it provides functionality that other apps can use.  In software engineering jargon, this is often called an application program interface (API).  In many cases, their may be interfaces where a human can interact with the service as well, either to add new information or do one-off lookups of information. 

### Listbuilder

URL: [https://listbuilder.tribapps.com/](https://listbuilder.tribapps.com/)

#### What does it do?

Listbuilder is a [microservice](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) that provides a REST API that other applications can use to create and retrieve lists of arbitrary things. 

#### How do I use it?

You need to login to the Django admin for this app and create a new list.  Then add the JavaScript library to your project.  Finally, interact with Listbuilder's REST API using the JavaScript library.

More information about this service can be found in the [project README](https://tribune.unfuddle.com/a#/projects/6/repositories/338/file?path=%2FREADME.md)

#### When should I use it?

* You have a static site but you want to add some user interactivity by allowing them to select items.  We originally built the service for the [Eat This, Drink This](http://apps.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/dining/eatthis/) dining guide and also used it for [Bears Predictions](http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/bears-breakdown/2015/predictions/) to handle the user picks.
* Your content is already structured around a list of things

#### When shouldn't I use it?

* When you don't have a unique way to identify users
* When you're collecting sensitive or private information from users
* If you've never worked with a REST API and don't have time to learn about them generally
* If you haven't used a library in your JavaScript code
