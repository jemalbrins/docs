SEO
===

There's no one-size-fits-all recipe for SEO optimization, but over time we've learned some tips and
rules that are reasonably applicable to most Tribune projects. At the end of this page, we've put
together a basic `optimization checklist <#appendix-optimization-checklist>`_, heavily based on the
excellent `Moz on-page grader tool <https://moz.com/researchtools/on-page-grader>`_ (ask the SEO
team if you'd like to use it with the Tribune account).

Appendix: Optimization checklist
--------------------------------

This section is broken into a must-have and a nice-to-have section, reflecting the fact that some
aspects of SEO really are extremely important, and others are simply quite helpful. Not to say the
latter group isn't extremely important (the list here contains only a small handful of the most
important suggestions), but 

Must-have:
text not JS
headlines are H1s
images have alt text
page has title tag and meta description
page has opengraph and schema.org tags, including image previews

Nice-to-haves:
title tag has important keywords somewhere
don't use targeted keywords more than 15 times
has a canonical url
important keywords in image alt tags, page meta description
page titles work after truncating 70 chars (or are no longer than 70)
links to external stuff
