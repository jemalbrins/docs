Editing these documents
-----------------------

Many of these documents are written in a markup language called [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) (rst) and build with a documentation generator called [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). However, they can also be written in Markdown.  Files ending in `.rst` are written in reStructuredText and files ending in `.md` are written in Markdown.

reStructuredText is a bit more complicated to use than Markdown, but is better suited for documentation because it has conventions for linking between documentation sections.  Check out the "User Documentation" section at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for help.  In most cases, you should be able to pick up the syntax from the existing files.
